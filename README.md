## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera, offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. This comprehensive program, led by AI visionary Andrew Ng, covers a wide range of topics in machine learning, providing both theoretical knowledge and practical skills to build real-world AI applications.

## What I have Learned

Throughout this specialization, I have gained proficiency in:

- Building machine learning models in Python using NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Construct and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification.
- Develop neural networks for multi-class classification using TensorFlow.
- Apply best practices for machine learning development to ensure generalization to real-world data.
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods (random forests, boosted trees).
- Utilize unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with collaborative filtering and content-based deep learning.
- Create deep reinforcement learning models.

## Certification

I have successfully completed the Machine Learning Specialization and earned a certificate. Feel free to explore the projects and code in this repository to get a glimpse of my work through this program.
